Value and Respect all team members: Give everyone a chance to include their input and actively listen

Participation is expected by all members on the team: Be active in group discussions, ask questions, and confirm understanding. 

Meetings: We will meet on Tuesday and Thursday nights during class at 7pm, when possible. If more time is needed, we will discuss as a group when all team members can meet again.

Channels of Communication: "Group Project" channel in Slack and group text message. Consistenly check and acknowledge communcations posted to channels to ensure all group members have up to date information. 

All group discussions will end with an "action plan" or key takaways. A recap will be posted to our slack channel as a resource. After an action plan is set in motion, get started right away to ensure other members are not waiting for your part and all work is submitted on time.
