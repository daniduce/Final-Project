Project Summary

For this project our team analyzed weather patterns in the North Atlantic region to determine the factors that contribute to storm strikes in Florida.  We gathereed tropical storm data from NOAA.gov and imported the data into a Pandas notebook.  
From there we processed the data, dropping unnecessary columns and filtering the data to the North Atlantic basin.  We took geojson values for our target area and built a second table with this data.  We calculated geohash values to determine storm
strikes in our target area.  From there the data was exported to Postgress for further database processing.  We wrote queries to combine tables and to determine which storms struck the target area.  We also created summary tables for the data.
We imported the data back to Pandas and continued to analyze the data with logistic regression analysis.  We presented our data using Tableau showing the data on charts and maps.
