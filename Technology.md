# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Pandas will enable us create and manipulate data frames; known for its efficiency in data analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database system we will use for the project. All analysis and results will be stored here, from cleaning, sorting and merging multiple tables including our result if needed

## Machine Learning
We will use ScikitLearn machine learning library from python to develop our models and predictions.
We will use methods in the library for our probability prediction; one of the cases is to predict the probability that a named storm will reach landfall within a 50mile radius area in the states

## Dashboard
We will employ the use of Tableau as our visualization tool. A very good interactive software with drill down and interactive functionality. This will be used to help present our insight and tell a better story
