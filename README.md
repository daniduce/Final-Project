# Final-Project

## Topic: Hurricane Analysis

The inspiration for this topic is based loosely on the learnings we did in module 13, "Mapping Earthquakes". Taking in to account the segments and weekly deliverables set in place, the noteworthy dataset on hurricanes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meets the criteria for the final project.

Description of Source Data: The data we are implementing is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's hurricane tracking since 1980.(ibtracs.since1980.list.v04r00.csv)

Our main question we hope to answer is: What is the probability that a hurricane will make landfall within a 50 mile radius area in the Eastern United States?

## Team Protocols:

*	Value and Respect all team members: Give everyone a chance to include their input and actively listen
* Participation is expected by all members on the team: Be active in group discussions, ask questions, and confirm understanding.
* Meetings: We will meet on Tuesday and Thursday nights during class at 7pm, when possible. If more time is needed, we will discuss as a group when all team members  can meet again.
* Channels of Communication: "Group Project" channel in Slack and group text message. Consistently check and acknowledge communications posted to channels to ensure all group members have up to date information.
* All group discussions will end with an "action plan" or key takeaways. A recap will be posted to our slack channel as a resource. After an action plan is set in motion, get started right away to ensure other members are not waiting for your part and all work is submitted on time.
