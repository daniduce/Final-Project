# Final-Project

Topic: Hurricane Analysis

The reason for this topic is based loosely on the learnings we did in module 13. We felt there is a sufficient amount of data covering hurricanes.  

Description of Source Data: The data we are using is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's hurricane trackings since 1980. (ibtracs.since1980.list.v04r00.csv)

Our main question we hope to answer is: What is the probability that a hurricane will make landfall within a 50 mile radius area in the Eastern United States?
