# Final-Project

Topic: Hurricane Analysis

The reason for this topic is based loosely on the learnings we did in module 13. We felt there is a sufficient amount of data covering hurricanes.  

Description of Source Data: The data we are using is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's hurricane trackings since 1980. (ibtracs.since1980.list.v04r00.csv)

Our main question we hope to answer is: What is the probability that a hurricane will make landfall within a 50 mile radius area in the Eastern United States? 

## Team Protocols

* Value and Respect all team members: Give everyone a chance to include their input and actively listen

* Participation is expected by all members on the team: Be active in group discussions, ask questions, and confirm understanding. 

* Meetings: We will meet on Tuesday and Thursday nights during class at 7pm, when possible. If more time is needed, we will discuss as a group when all team members can meet again.

* Channels of Communication: "Group Project" channel in Slack and group text message. Consistenly check and acknowledge communcations posted to channels to ensure all group members have up to date information. 

* All group discussions will end with an "action plan" or key takaways. A recap will be posted to our slack channel as a resource. After an action plan is set in motion, get started right away to ensure other members are not waiting for your part and all work is submitted on time.
